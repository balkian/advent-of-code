My takes on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.
I mostly use these exercises as a way to learn new languages.

So far I've done:

* 2020 (**Complete**) in Rust, with some Python code for some sanity checks.
* 2018 (mostly complete) in Go.
* 2015 (barely started) in Rust. I started it because I got hooked while doing 2020 and at some point I could not wait a whole day for a new challenge :)
