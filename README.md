My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.
I mostly use AoC as a way to learn new languages, so don't expect quality or idiomatic code :)

So far I've done (in this order):

* 2021 (Almost complete) in Rust.
* 2020 (**Complete**) in Rust, with some Python code for some sanity checks.
* 2018 (**Complete**) in Rust.
* 2015 (42/50) in Rust. I took a long break, so the solutions use two different structures.
* 2018 (mostly complete) in Go.
